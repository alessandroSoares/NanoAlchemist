# NanoAlchemist
Some C# projects to control a *SLA/DLP 3D Printers* 

### Description
This project has the purpose of control **SLA/DLP 3D Printers** with a NanoDLP Shield on the Raspberry PI running **Windows IoT Core**. A WS run in the board receiving commands over the http protocol and execute them.

### NanoDLP Shield

### Parts
* **NanoAlchemist.Display**: An UWP project to control the images displayed on HDMI port, also responsible for control the printer process, displaying the image e calling the service of the movement to move the base.
* **NanoAlchemist.WS**: A *Background Application (IoT)* that get the Http Request and send them to the service of the movement to control the 3D Printer. All the outside commands come from this service.
* **NanoAlchemist.MovementService**: A *Background Application (IoT)* that communicate directly with the board. The control of the motor and endstops are made in this project. The project also responsible to mediate the communication between **NanoAlchemist.WS** and **NanoAlchemist.Display**.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Create a documentation
- [ ] Fixed the *CreationalWorkstationFile* class to convert correctly the file generated by the **Creational Worstation**
- [ ] Create readers for Slic3r, SparkStudio
- [ ] Change the priority of the UI and put on the Movement Service. When a mouse is moved in the Display during a movement, the movement it seems difficult
